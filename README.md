<br>This assignment utilizes the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze drug regimen data as it relates to tumor development in mice. </br>

<br>A Jupyter Notebook was successfully generated that contains a summary data table for all drug regimens. The summary table shows the following for each drug regimen:
<li>Mean</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Variance</li>
<li>Standard Deviation</li>
<li>SEM</li>
</br>

<br>Multiple visuals were created to enhance the data analysis. Bar charts were successfully produced to illustrate the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen. Pie charts were also created to show the distribution of mice by gender. </br>


For each drug regimen, the following calculations were determined through coding:
<li>Quartiles</li>
<li>IQR
<li>Outlier boundaries</li>
<li>All potential outliers</li>


<br>A box and whisker plot were formed to show the final tumor volume for all four (4) treatment regimens. Additionally, outliers were identified.</br>

<br>Further visuals, including a line plot and scatter plot were developed for the specified drug regimen. </br>

<br>The code is finalized by completing a correlation and regression analysis. </br>
ðŸ¤”
<br>Leveraging the data analysis and visuals, three (3) observations were made regarding the data set.</br>
